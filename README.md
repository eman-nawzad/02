# SPI Drought Monitoring Application

This is a Streamlit-based application for visualizing and analyzing SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index) data. The app uses GeoTIFF format for SPI data and Folium for map visualizations.

## Project Structure

- **SPI_12_2023.tif**: The raw SPI data in GeoTIFF format.
- **app.py**: The main application script that displays the map and visualizations.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies required to run the app.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and folders to ignore when using version control (e.g., `__pycache__/`, `.env`, etc.).

## Running the Application

To run the app locally, make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies and start the Streamlit app:

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
